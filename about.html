        <h4>The Story</h4>
      <p>Taco rice originated in Okinawa, Japan during the 1980s.  In response to the US troops being stationed in Okinawa after WWII, Matsuzo Gibo created taco rice as a way to blend the two cultures.  Taco rice became a huge hit with both the US troops and the Japanese.  Taco rice is an amazing example of how food can bring two totally different cultures together.

This is why I chose to bring taco rice to the USA.  The USA is the melting pot of the world, with representation from almost every single culture.  As a person from a culturally blended family, I am lucky enough to witness this melting pot action first hand.  My father was born and raised in the United States and my mother was born in Okinawa.  I grew up eating all this amazingly blended foods, that no one I talk to has ever even heard about.  By blending cultures, you can create something amazing.  Taco rice combines the American Tex-Mex style with the umami flavors of Japan.  I want to unite cultures and people through food.
